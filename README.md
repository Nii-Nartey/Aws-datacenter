# AWS Datacenter Terraform Template

This repository contains a set of Terraform configuration files that define various AWS resources for setting up a datacenter infrastructure. These resources are designed to help you provision and manage your AWS infrastructure efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Terraform**: Make sure you have Terraform installed. You can download it from [terraform.io](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

- **AWS Account**: You need an AWS account to provision resources. Make sure you have your AWS access credentials configured properly, either through environment variables or the shared credentials file.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nii-Nartey/Aws-datacenter.git
   cd aws-datacenter

2. **Initialize Terraform**: Run the following command to initialize Terraform:
terraform init
3. **Review Configuration**: Navigate through the .tf files in the repository to review and customize the resources you want to provision. Adjust variables and configurations according to your needs.

4. **Provision Resources**: Once you've customized the configuration, provision the resources:
   terraform apply
   Terraform will display a plan of the resources to be created. Confirm by typing yes.

5. **Destroy Resources** (if needed): If you want to tear down the provisioned resources, use:
terraform destroy
Confirm by typing yes.
